Relational Intelligence Engine for Python

**Update, 24 Nov 2014: Pylog is being rewritten!**

Pylog has become a great deal larger than the simple personal side-project it
began as and is really starting to outgrow its environment and trip over its
original, more casual design. Efforts are now focused on rewriting the project.

---

**Pylog** is a relational intelligence engine for Python, implementing concepts
from graph theory with notation reminiscent of Prolog, designed to expose every
aspect and insight from the input relational data. Use Pylog to...

* Model a network of friends and make friendship recommendations
* Store and analyze information about music, movies, video games or books
* Map out a street system and find routes
* Do pretty much anything else you could possibly imagine!
